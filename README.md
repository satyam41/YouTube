1. Area and perimeter of the circle.
     In this program user input any radius of the circle and 
     choose their choice what he want to calculate perimeter or area.

2. Program to read number and calculate its square otherwise calculate cube.
     In this program user input a number and computer check the number is ODD or EVEN 
     when number is ODD its calculate square or the number is EVEN calculate cube.

3. Line Graph
     In this program user can see their growth, covid-19 cases with the help of line graph
     Python gives us this feature to make any graph with the module name "matplotlib.pyplot".

4. Bar graph 
     In this program user can see their growth, covid-19 cases with the help of bar graph
     Python gives us this feature to make any graph with the module name "matplotlib.pyplot".

5. Binary Search 
     In this program user can search any result from the list. This search can work both side
     beginning and end to the list. It break the list in two parts. for example list have 10 elements 
     binary search, search as first it break/divide the list into two parts 1st half is 1 to 5 and 2nd half is 6 to 10
     then it check the number is greater than 5 or smaller than 5. If the number is greater than 5 all left side of the element is deleted from the list for a while (the elements is not delete permanently)
     then the all right side of the data is again break/divide into two parts then it check again the number is greater than 8 or smaller than 8. If the number is 8  it show number is present in the list.
     It check any elements present in the list 2 to 3 steps.

6. Awesome made in Python
